# custom-truncate
Truncate string using custom method.

I wrote this package because I need to truncate and split long string message to be send by SMS or some messaging services like Telegram.

It is still on alpha development version. Only support 'line' method now. Future API might be broken with current version.

It will implements truncate methods like:
- lines
- words

TODO: complete this package and write nice documentation.
